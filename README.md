# machine_learning

I'm taking the Machine Learning course offered by Coursera.</br>

They use Octave/Matlab in this lecture, however, I prefer Python and I've played around with libSVM before. 
I decide to use Pyhton for all the exercises.</br>

It's actaully quite funny that I built the app [EMMA](https://github.com/doggyeh/EMMA-Machine-Learning) with
Machine Learning(libSVM) and Natural Language Processing(NLTK) with zero knowledge of both at first. That's a
starup competition, therefore, I just built it at fast as possible. I read the documents, google, and squeeze
my head to deliver a prototype of an AI product.</br>

I'm going to learn Machine Learning from scratch because I believe this is the future and I really enjoy it!
